          <h1>Michael Craddock Jr</h1>
          <p> Hello Internet! My name is Michael Clyde Craddock Jr. I
            hail from a small town called New Castle in the beautiful state of Virginia.
            Growing up, I always dreamed of living my life in the big city. My allegiances
            lie in the swimming pool, my teammates, and my family. One thing people must
            know about me is that I am a “people person” that will do whatever it takes to
            enhance the lives of others. </p>

            <p> I am currently a sophomore student-athlete at Virginia Tech. I am
              pursuing a double major in Professional and Technical Writing &
              Literature and Language. On top of this, I am chasing a minor in
              Sociology. I chose these subjects of study because I would like to
              become a lawyer one day that is well versed in English and diverse
              groups of people. Specifically, I would like to have a career in family
              law. Growing up, little Michael despised anything English related
              whether it be reading, writing, or interpreting ideas. I always thought
              they were the most boring activities ever. However, as I matured, I
              randomly picked up books and began to fall in love with the processes of
              storytelling, words, and phrases. English is that it is all about
              perspective and so is the legal system. English has no clear definite
              answer and I find the autonomy within our language beautiful. </p>

              <p> For this project, Child Safety
                is the main focus. The reason I decided to launch my website in regards
                to "child safety" is due to the fact that I had a very unique childhood.
                I was fortunate to attend both public and private schools in both large
                and small cities. During my years at elementary school, I bonded with
                people of many ages and backgrounds. These years were some of the most
                eye-opening of my life because I did encounter children of my age who
                had lesser-than-ideal family scenarios. Seeing these kids
                day-in-and-day-out really inspired me to make a difference, to raise
                awareness. I want adults, who have legal rights, to learn about the
                stories of these children to pledge to be aware of everyday children who
                need help. Below is an example website of what I would like to
                accomplish: </P> <a href=http://www.safekids.org/></a>
